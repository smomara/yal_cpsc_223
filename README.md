# Data Structures and Programming Techniques

This document outlines my progress and exercises based on James Aspnes' [notes](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html) from his course, "CPSC 223: Data Structures and Programming Techniques" taught at Yale in Spring 2022.

## Exercises

Below are the exercises I've worked on, along with the relevant files

### Exercise 1: Hello World Program

**Instructions**: Write a program that prints the string `"Hello, world!` followed by a newline character to stdout without using the characters `'l'`, `'L'`, `'1'`, `'|'`, `'o'`, `'O'`, or `'0'` in source files, except in lines starting with `#include`. The program should also return the standard success code `0` from `main`.
